# Description
Tic-tac-toe is fun,tactic game played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game. We can choose any symbol, as there is not restriction in that & any player can go first.
